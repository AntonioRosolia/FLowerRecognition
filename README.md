# FLowerRecognition

Introduction
The flower dataset contains 4242 images of flowers. The data collection is based on the data flicr, google images, yandex images. The pictures are divided into five classes: chamomile, tulip, rose, sunflower, dandelion. For each class there are about 800 photos. Photos are not high resolution, about 320x240 pixels. Photos are not reduced to a single size, they have different proportions!

Objectives
The aim of this project is to classify a photo of a plant to the correct plant species. The image classification is done using Deep Learning (Keras).

Approach
In this project Keras is used to build a convolutional neural network for image classification.

The following layers will be added to the CNN:
-Convolutional Layer
-Pooling Layer
-Flattening Layer
-Neural Network
